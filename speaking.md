I love giving technical talks about hard problems I've hit in the past. If you're interested in having me speak at your conference, please send me an [email](mailto:speaking@mrobinson.ca).

# Outages and oopsies: A look at doing TLS/mTLS wrong and how to do it right

It turns out that TLS/mTLS is actually quite easy to get right if you lean into the how it's supposed to work.
If you fight the standard, in the best case you went waste a huge amount of engineering time and the worst case you will have downtime.

# How much is that API call in the window

Cost efficiency is the new reliability. It's absolutely essential that in addition to latency and reliability that companies consider the cost of running their services.
The best made services are cheap to run, and the worst services are the most expensive. These services can be 10x as expensive as well written serives.

# Zero-touch deployments: Keeping 300 devs from having to know Kubernetes

Developers hate doing operations work, so it's important to automate it. The most reliable systems are ones that are exercised every day and happen automatically.
You can improve deployment reliability and speed by automating aggressively and focusing on "The right choice is the easy choice". Engineers should be in the situation where their natural instincts produce the best results.
